            <h2>About Crispy kitchen</abbr></h2>
            <p> Driven by passion and fuelled by pure adoration towards food, “The Crispy kitchen” was started in June of 2017, in a humble kiosk in the city of Guntur, Andhra Pradesh. From there we spread to 20 cities with 35 outlets within a span of 6 years, without any active marketing and just the help of our loyal customers who loved the taste of our food.</p>
